What are the benefits of integration, and how is it done? Does Thales CipherTrust Manager (CTM) replace your Active Directory Group policy?\\n\\nIn the previous blog post, we went through the deployment of the CipherTrust Manager in our VMware environment. In today\u2019s post, we will focus our discussion on how to integrate the newly provisioned OVA with the company Active Directory, a necessary step for activities we will discuss in our future posts.\\n\\n## The Why\\n\\nTo streamline the management of your company\u2019s security requirements, and to easily manage your access and control of the company files and directories, it is a good idea to integrate CTM with Active Directory as a source of user management. By doing this, you can assign your policies more easily by basing them on the company AD Users and Groups.\\n\\n## The How\\n\\nNow let\u2019s focus on the fun technical part, the integration. The first step before we start the configuration is to get some information from AD; so, let\u2019s run the following PowerShell command to retrieve the necessary information for our configuration: ![Get ADuser](./img/get_aduser.png)\\n\\nThe output will be as shown below:\\n\\n![AD Info](./img/AD_Info.webp)\\n\\nAfter you have retrieved the above information, we are ready to head back to our CTM and browse to: Access Management -> LDAP. From the top right corner, select \u201c+ Add LDAP\u201c:\\n\\n![CTM_LDAP](./img/CTM_LDAP.webp)\\n\\nOn the pop-up config windows, provide the following information:\\n* Connection Name: any\\n* Server URL: your AD IP/DNS name\\n* Bind DN: CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=oasis,DC=org\\n* Server Bind Password: account password\\n* Rood DN: DC=oasis,DC=org\\n* User login name attribute: sAMAccountName\\n![AD_Bind-1](./img/AD_Bind-1.webp)\\n\\nAfter you have tested the configurations to be correct and are ready to accept it, click on the \u201cAdd LDAP\u201d button at the bottom right corner.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nToday\u2019s blog is very important; this post is setting the foundation for our next exciting topic, Thales Transparent Encryption feature. As you may have noticed, to integrate the CTM with AD is a very simple, but important operation. Next week, we going to use the configuration setup today to access and encrypt the company\u2019s critical data."},{"id":"Data-Security-in-DevOps","metadata":{"permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/Data-Security-in-DevOps","editUrl":"https://github.com/thalesgroup/ThalesGroup.github.io/tree/main/ciphertrust/blog/2023-04-18-data-security-without-DevOps-disruption.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-18-data-security-without-DevOps-disruption.md","title":"Data Security without DevOps Disruption","description":"Note - this article was originally posted on Hal\'s blog on March 24, 2023 under the title \\"CipherTrust Transparent Encryption.\\"","date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"data-encryption","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/tags/data-encryption"},{"label":"devops","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/tags/devops"},{"label":"data-security","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/tags/data-security"}],"readingTime":7.465,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hal Yaman (B.Sc)","title":"Sales Engineering Manager @ Thales","imageURL":"https://i0.wp.com/cloudoasis.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_0054-30x40.jpg?resize=225%2C300&ssl=1","key":"hal"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"Data-Security-in-DevOps","title":"Data Security without DevOps Disruption","authors":"hal","tags":["data-encryption","devops","data-security"]},"prevItem":{"title":"CipherTrust and Active Directory","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/CipherTrust and Active Directory"},"nextItem":{"title":"A Guide to Picking the Right Key Manager for Your Org","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/choosing-a-key-manager"}},"content":"Note - this article was originally posted on Hal\'s blog on March 24, 2023 under the title \\"CipherTrust Transparent Encryption.\\"\\n\\nIn many organisations, IT departments are sometimes required to delegate some of their responsibilities to other teams, but at the same time, also required to keep control of the company security. Wait! In the world of security, can data security become a delegated responsibility? If that is a yes, then how?\\n\\nFive years ago, I was pulled into the DevOps team culture and mindset. Since then, I have been lucky enough to manage the building of several DevOps teams. One of the many attributes of the DevOps culture is their autonomy. DevOps teams build in a way that can execute a task from end to end. The teams build up while working through the requirements and functions of the project or product, and with this knowledge, go on to find the most effective way of breaking the silos encountered by traditional teams.\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nThe previous paragraph described DevOps as being about speed of delivery and autonomy, which also requires the team to access resources that are not always managed within the team; Active Directory, file shares, and so on are examples of these resources. So, how can you keep your DevOps team focused, but not affect the company processes?\\n\\n### Scenario\\n\\nLet\u2019s put the DevOps information above into context using a real scenario I came across last week with one of the teams I help to build two years ago.\\n\\nCompany A was working on a confidential application for a client; the client was concerned that a breach of their code data would expose their intellectual property to competitors, or would become general knowledge.\\n\\nThe client asked that the following hierarchy be implemented to help mitigate their risk:\\n\\n* Each Team has it own encrypted directory\\n* Only the specific team can access and read the code\\n* Admin can manage the files within all the directories, but cannot read the code\\n\\n### The Challenge\\n\\nFrom those requirements, Company A faces the following challenges:\\n\\n* How to implement access management and encryption at the same time\\n* How to avoid disruption of the DevOps team concept\\n* Delegate security manageability to the DevOps team without affecting the wider company policy\\n\\n### Solution\\n\\nAccess management can be controlled using the company Active Directory; but doing so will complicate the workflow of the DevOps team and will slow the delivery. At the same time, Active Directory and Group Policies do not offer encryption, so the IT department turned to Thales CipherTrust Manager to solve this challenge.\\n\\n### Implementation\\n\\nTo achieve all the security requirements, Company A decided to use CipherTrust Manager with the Transparent Encryption feature. Using Transparent Encryption Live Data Transformation (LDT), Company A can delegate the code data management to the DevOps team, but at the same time, encrypt the data and also keep Admin in control of managing and backing up the code files without compromising security.\\n\\nSo let\u2019s learn how company A uses CipherTrust Manager to keep each team in control.\\n\\n### CipherTrust User and Domain\\n\\nTo delegate responsibilities, the Company A IT team was looking for a multi-tenanted system that can help the department to easily create and assign multiple teams to manage their own security requirements, while remaining isolated from each other. This requirement can be met with Thales CTM by creating a Domain to allow the DevOps team to manage their access control and security needs.\\n\\nTo create a Domain, you first create a user by browsing to **\u201cAccess Management -> Users -> Add User\u201c:**\\n![Add_User](img/adduser.webp)\\n\\nAfter you have added the user, apply the user to **CTE Admins and Clients** by going to **Edit/view** the user. Under **Groups**, Search **CTE** and add to **Admin/Client**:\\n![CTE_Groups](img/CTE_Groups.webp)\\n\\nThe next step is to browse to \u201c**Admin Settings -> Domains**\u201d and click \u201c**Add Domain**\u201c:\\n\\n* Name: DevOps\\n* Admins: devops (the user you just created)\\n* Choose the default CA\\n* Save\\n![Add_Domain](img/Add_Domain.webp)\\n\\nNow you are ready to logout and then login with the user you just created. After logging in again, change the domain to the new domain at the top right corner \u2013 **Switch Domains**:\\n![Switch_Domains](img/switchdomains.webp)\\n\\n### Create a Key\\n\\nTo be able to encrypt the data, we must create a key. Creating a key is very simple with CipherTrust Manager, all you need is to browse to the keys at the left menu and press the \u201c**Add key**\u201c. The next step is to provide a Key name: for example we will create a key name: **LDT_Key** and then press\u201d**Add Key**\u201d to save it.\\n\\nAt the next window, expand the \u201c**Key Access**\u201d option. On the search bar, type \u201c**CTE**\u201d with show all groups, then tick the check boxes for all the Admins and Clients permissions. Press **Update**:\\n![Key_Access](img/keyaccess.webp)\\n\\nNext, browse to \u201c**Key Labels -> CTE**\u201c. Choose **CBC** from the drop down menu\u201d. Press **Update**:\\n![Key_Label](img/Keylable.webp)\\n\\n### Install the Transparent Encryption Agent\\n\\nTo be able to install and use the Transparent Encryption feature, you must install an agent. The first step is to create a \u201c**Registration Token**\u201c; this will be used during the agent installation to add the agent to the CipherTrust Manager. To create the Token, browse to \u201c**Access Management -> Registration Tokens**\u201d and click on \u201c**Add Registration Token**\u201d and complete the following entries:\\n\\n* Provide a Name Prefix: on my case DevOps_token\\n* Local CA: choose the default\\n* Create a token: Base64\\n![Create_Token](img/createToken.webp)\\n\\nCopy the token; then go to your Windows or Linux machine to run the agent installation. During the installation, you will be asked to provide:\\n\\n* Componant to register: File System\\n* CipherTrust Manager IP/Hostname\\n* Enable LDT Feature (FS agent only)\\n* Token\\n\\nAfter the installation is completed and you have successfully rebooted, you will be able to see the registered client on your CipherTrust Manager under: **Transparent Encryption -> Clients**:\\n![CTE_Client](img/CTE_Client.webp)\\n\\nCreating Policies:\\n\\nAfter deploying the agent and connecting it to the CTM, we can focus on creating our polices. As we have four different teams in our example, lets create four policies as shown below:\\n\\n* DevOps_Admin_Team: Access and manage files and directories but can read files content\\n* DevOps_Dev_Team: access only Development directory\\n* DevOps_Ops_Policy: access only operation directory\\n* DevOps_QA_Team: access only QA diretory\\n\\nLet\u2019s create first policy, the **DevOps_Admin_Team** policy by browsing to \u201c**Transparent Encryption -> Policies -> Create policy**\u201c:\\n\\n* Name: DevOps_Admin_Team\\n* Policy Type: Live Data Transformation\\n* Security Rules: + Create Security Rule\\n    * User Set \u2013 Select \u2013 Create User Set:\\n        * Name: Admin_Team\\n        * Create User\\n            * Agent \u2013 select Agent\\n            * User Type: LDAP\\n            * Member Choice: User or Group (on my case I choose group)\\n            * gname: group name\\n        * Note: repeat the above steps to create all the users for each group (i.e: Admin, Dev, Ops and QA team. on each time you need to create a policy you can easily choose the appropriate group or user)\\n    * Action \u2013 Select\\n        * All_Ops\\n    * Effect \u2013 Select\\n        * select permit\\n        * ApplyKey only of other group but not Admin group as the admin will not be able to unencrypt the data so a key not required\\n* Key Rules: Create key Rule\\n    * Current Key Name: Select \u2013 \u201cclear_key\u201d\\n    * Tranformation Key Name: Select \u2013 LTD_Key\\n    * Add\\n* Next \u2013 Confirmation \u2013 Save\\n\\nNote: repeat the above steps for all the groups\\n\\n### Create GuardPoint\\n\\nOur last step is to apply these policies to our folders or client. In this example, I will be using a Windows client. So let\u2019s get started:\\n\\nAs we have different teams and policies, each with different access, we must create a different client **GuardPoint**. Browse to **Transparent Encryption -> Clients**. Choose the client \u2013 \u201c**Create GuardPoint**\u201c:\\n\\n* Select Policy: choose DevOps_QA_Team\\n* Path: browse to the QA directory and select \u201cselect Path\u201d\\n* Create\\n\\nNote: repeat for each team and select the appropriate directory\\n![Create_GuardPoint](img/createguardpoint.webp)\\n\\nAfter all the directories are assigned to a group \u2013 on each GuardPoint \u2013 press the policy name and add the right action for each team as shown below; for example:\\n\\n* Development_Team can access, and apply key\\n* Operation_Team no access\\n* Admin_Team access but no key\\n![DevOps_Permission_Group](img/devops_permission_group.webp)\\n\\nNote: repeat for all other GuardPoints\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nAfter Following the steps described above, you can check that your new configuration works by accessing your Windows machine with a different user; for example, QA, dev, ops or admin, then check to see if you can access or read the files. The above steps are a little involved, more than Active Directory Group Policies; but with CipherTrust you also get the encryption aspect with a full and controlled separation of responsibilities.\\n\\nCompany A was able to achieve their client\u2019s security request; but at the same time, did not affect the team processes, autonomy, and control. At both levels, Company A IT and DevOps, it was a win \u2013 win situation."},{"id":"choosing-a-key-manager","metadata":{"permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/choosing-a-key-manager","editUrl":"https://github.com/thalesgroup/ThalesGroup.github.io/tree/main/ciphertrust/blog/2022-11-17-how-to-choose-a-key-manager-for-orgs.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-11-17-how-to-choose-a-key-manager-for-orgs.md","title":"A Guide to Picking the Right Key Manager for Your Org","description":"Your company has a ton of daily active users and you have this amazingly efficient architecture to process requests at scale, but your InfoSec team asks you to use a key manager \u2014 there are so many out there, which one do you choose?","date":"2022-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"data-encryption","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/tags/data-encryption"},{"label":"key-management","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/tags/key-management"}],"readingTime":3.655,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Pranav Shikarpur","title":"Developer Advocate @ Thales","url":"https://twitter.com/snpranav","imageURL":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1615654854642503680/AZA332Xo_400x400.jpg","key":"pranav"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"choosing-a-key-manager","title":"A Guide to Picking the Right Key Manager for Your Org","authors":"pranav","tags":["data-encryption","key-management"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Data Security without DevOps Disruption","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/Data-Security-in-DevOps"},"nextItem":{"title":"A Guide to Data Security Architectures","permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/a-guide-to-encryption-architectures"}},"content":"Your company has a ton of daily active users and you have this amazingly efficient architecture to process requests at scale, but your InfoSec team asks you to use a key manager \u2014 there are so many out there, which one do you choose?\\n\\nThere are various different types of key managers, but in this post, we\u2019ll cover the three most common key managers:\\n\\n* Native Cloud Key Managers (Ex \u2014 AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, etc.)\\n\\n* External Key Managers (Ex \u2014 Thales CipherTrust Manager, etc.)\\n\\n* Hybrid Key Managers (Use the best of both worlds \u2014 Cloud managed services and external key managers)\\n\\n## First, the literal  key to security \u2014 HSMs\\n\\nHSM stands for \u201c[Hardware Security Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module)\u201d. These are physical devices that are usually tamper resistant which store keys and perform encrypt, decrypt and other cryptographic operations.\\n\\nHSMs are needed in secure environments such as healthcare or financial institutions where you need to pass compliances such as PCI DSS.\\n\\n## Now Let\u2019s Compare\\n\\nLet\u2019s look at the pros and cons of each to help you decide what would work best for your organization.\\n\\n### Cloud Key Managers\\n\\n\u2705 **Easy Integration with Cloud Managed Services**\\n\\nWhen using cloud key managers like [AWS KMS (Key Management Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) it can be advantageous as you get the flexibility of AWS managing your keys as well as direct integration into your existing AWS managed services such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), or [AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/rods/), etc.\\n\\n\u2705 **HSMs provisioned and managed by a cloud provider (most of the time \ud83e\udd1e)**\\n\\nMost famous cloud providers have HSMs that they use in their data centers which store your keys, so you don\u2019t have to worry about renting an HSM.\\n\\n**\u274c No Separation of Trust \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f**\\n\\nSince your cloud provider now hosts and controls your data and encryption keys. Your user data might not be as safe anymore as the cloud provider with malicious intent could easily decrypt your user data. This does not help in creating a **zero-trust architecture**. While it\u2019s true that your cloud provider has your best interest; there are always hackers lurking around the internet trying to get malicious access to your data, so it\u2019s best to store data in an isolated environment.\\n\\n### External Key Managers\\n\\n**\u2705 Complete Separation of Trust**\\n\\nWhen running a product such as CipherTrust Manager, your architectures are zero-trust by default as 2 different entities have access to either your data or your keys and **NOT both**.\\n\\n**\u274c Build your own custom integrations**\\n\\nUnless the key manager service has connectors, many-a-times, you would need to build your own connectors which could put a lot of engineering debt on your teams.\\n\\n\u26a0\ufe0f** Need to rent out your own HSM**\\n\\nYou\u2019d need to manage your own HSM, but fortunately, there are service providers that will rent out and manage the HSMs (just like a cloud provider) \u2014 so this is neither a pro nor a con. A great example of a hosted HSM is the [Luna HSM](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/data-protection-on-demand/services/luna-cloud-hsm).\\n\\n## **Best of Both Worlds \ud83e\udd14**\\n\\nYes, it\u2019s possible! To implement the best data security practices, you would want the ease of integration with cloud-managed services as well as complete separation of trust to isolate encryption keys from data. This method is also called **BYOK **(bring your own key).\\n\\nYou can do this with products such as CipherTrust Manager [Cloud Key Manager](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/key-management/ciphertrust-cloud-key-manager). This offers:\\n\\n**\u2705 Direct connection with cloud-managed KMS account**\\n\\nOnce you connect your AWS or GCP or Azure account to CipherTrust Manager as shown in the tutorial linked below, you will be able to manage keys directly from CipherTrust Manager and encrypt data on cloud-managed services.\\n\\n**\u2705 Key Lifecycle Management in a few clicks**\\n\\nIn just a few clicks you can setup key rotation which will rotate your keys every few months and provide the best data security standards for your organization.\\n\\n### How do I implement this?\\n\\nLuckily, it\u2019s easy to implement in 3 simple steps. Here\u2019s a tutorial I made that demos connecting CipherTrust Manager to my AWS KMS (Key Management Service) account and encrypt my AWS managed services such as S3 and RDS.\\n\\nimport YoutubeEmbed from \'@site/src/components/YoutubeEmbed\';\\n\\n<YoutubeEmbed embedId=\\"9Cs9s7DpJFU\\" />\\n\\nNow go ahead and encrypt all your cloud-managed services using this hybrid BYOK approach!\\n\\nIf you have any issues with implementation or questions about data encryption, go to the CipherTrust community and post [a quesiton](https://supportportal.thalesgroup.com/community)."},{"id":"a-guide-to-encryption-architectures","metadata":{"permalink":"/ciphertrust/blog/a-guide-to-encryption-architectures","editUrl":"https://github.com/thalesgroup/ThalesGroup.github.io/tree/main/ciphertrust/blog/2022-10-08-encryption-architectures.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-08-encryption-architectures.md","title":"A Guide to Data Security Architectures","description":"Building and deploying applications and services is super exciting.

Still, when your security team prevents your application from going into production due to a lack of data encryption \u2014 this can be very annoying.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a look at the different data encryption methods that are most commonly used and how we can implement some of them.\\n\\nData encrypted at-rest vs in-transit?\\n=====================================\\n\\nWell, it\u2019s often hard to choose between encrypting a complete Postgres database or encrypting only specific fields of data in the database right before it gets written to a table.\\n\\nThe key difference between the two is that encrypting a database **after** data is written to it is called **data encryption at rest** and encrypting data **before** data is written to a database is called data encryption **in-transit**.\\n\\nThe illustration below should give you a good high-level understanding of the difference. Although data encryption at-rest was a standard encryption practice followed for many years, it involves developers writing and maintaining various different scripts or applications to ensure that the encryption is up to company standards. It is still useful while encrypting file systems and storage. On the other hand, data encryption in-transit is a lot more beneficial at times when you want to make your infrastructure database agnostic and provide high-security standards with significantly low developer effort.\\n\\n![Data Encryption at REST Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*7sOyc7n62Mxsq0cfKsLL0Q.png)\\n\\nNote that from the above diagram we can see that the method of encrypting data in-transit uses a **side-car container** which is a proxy used to intercept every request with sensitive fields or encrypted data and encrypt or decrypt the same respectively.\\n\\n![Data Encryption in-transit Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*9PC9Nv4j_L2LIoWsR4ZIeg.png)\\n\\nAdvantages of Data Encryption in-Transit\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n**\u2705 No change to applications**\\n\\nThe beauty of doing data-encryption in transit is that you don\u2019t need to worry about changing any of your frontend apps, APIs, or databases. Since the side-car container does field-level encryption, you can granularly control all the data that needs to be encrypted and decrypted by remotely setting access policies from your key manager.\\n\\n**\u2705 Easy to deploy**\\n\\nDeploying a [Data Protection Gateway](https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/ciphertrust-data-protection-gateway) side-car container is as easy to deploy as logging agents such as DataDog or Prometheus. You can just update your docker-compose, Kubernetes config files or just use Helm to install it.\\n\\n**\u2705 Developers can stop implementing data security policies**\\n\\nNow you can shift the responsibility of setting and implementing data security policies from developers over to InfoSec teams. This significantly helps prevent data breaches or unauthorized data access.\\n\\nDisadvantages of Data Encryption in-Transit\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\n\u274c **Data encryption is only as strong as policies set**\\n\\nThis applies to any method of data encryption. However, when we perform field-level encryption and decryption, InfoSec teams need to be aware of all data flowing through various API routes to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access to unencrypted data.\\n\\n---\\n\\nHow Do I Implement Data Encryption in-Transit?\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou\u2019re in luck \ud83d\ude4c because I have a tutorial showing you how to easily implement data encryption in-transit with any of your containerized applications.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, I have used [CipherTrust Manager](https://ciphertrust.io/)\u2019s Data Protection Gateway product which is extremely easy to set up and free to start using\ud83d\udc47\\n\\nimport YoutubeEmbed from \'@site/src/components/YoutubeEmbed\';\\n\\n<YoutubeEmbed embedId=\\"EJun5McPRGY\\" github=\\"https://github.com/ThalesGroup/learn-ciphertrust/tree/main/learn/dpg/data-encryption-in-transit-docker\\" demourl=\\"https://main-yak.sneakpeak.dev/\\" />\\n\\n---\\n\\nNow go ahead and encrypt data in-transit from all your applications using side-car containers.\\n\\nIf you have any issues with implementation or questions about data encryption in-transit, feel free to leave a comment, tweet [@snpranav](https://twitter.com/snpranav), or raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ThalesGroup/learn-ciphertrust/issues/new) :)"}]}')}}]);
